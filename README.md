# jetbrains-academy-maze-runner
Mazes are amazing: keep running, find the exit if you can! If you are not too happy about getting stuck in the actual maze, you can entertain yourself with a virtual one. 
In this project, you will write a program that generates mazes and looks for a way out.

The program has the ability to save and load mazes from a text file.
It generates a random maze of a specific size using an adaptation of the randomized Prim's algorithm.
It finds the unique path to the exit using a depth first search algorithm.
